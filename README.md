# Overview

This is a web app developed by a team that teaches the characters for the Dwarvish language, Cirth, a language made by J.R.R Tolkien. It was 
made as a project to help develop our skills at web development. The app will teach the language though lessons on each page. The lessons 
are based on directly translating a Cirth character into an English equivalent. After each lesson there is a quiz to test your knowledge of 
the characters. Each quiz so far is a multiple choice quiz that will give you a score. An API was made to fetch characters from a sqlite database
to make this work. The characters fetched for each lesson is based on viewsets that were made.
